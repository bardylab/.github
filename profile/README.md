http://www.bardylab.com/


The Bardy lab is a team of neurobiologists, electrophysiologists and bioinformaticians based at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI) and affiliateed with Flinders University.

Our laboratory has established a highthroughput platform in vitro to facilitate the discovery and validation of treatments for brain disorders. Our research is at the frontier of human cellular neuroscience research and translational applications that benefit global public health.

Our team has in-depth expertise in human neural stem cell (iPSC), electrophysiology (Patch-clamping, MEA), high-throughput imaging and transcriptomics (PatchSeq, scRNAseq, bulk RNAseq). Our research efforts are focused on advancing new stem cell biotechnologies and strategies to understand the effect of neurological disorders on brain cells.
